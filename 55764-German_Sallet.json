  "Info": "If you have freakish facial proportions or a massive chin, your face might clip through the front of the helmet. Also tends to clip with a lot of neck cosmetics, despite me trying my hardest to make them not to.

Due to modding limitations, it doesn't support tint, roughness, or the painted sallets."
